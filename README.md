# Boid Simulation with Pygame

This project is a Python-based simulation of boids (bird-like objects) exhibiting complex, dynamic patterns. The simulation demonstrates multiple motion styles, including orbits, lines, spirals, and triangles, with real-time interactivity through the mouse cursor.

## Features

- **Dynamic Motion Styles**: Explore four unique motion patterns, switchable during runtime:
  - **Style 1**: Orbital motion with dynamically varying radii and angular speeds.
  - **Style 2**: Linear motion with direction and distance influenced by random variation.
  - **Style 3**: Concentric spirals with Jupiter-like banding effects and structured randomness.
  - **Style 4**: Transitioning triangle patterns with oscillation between order and chaos.
- **Smooth Animation**: Boids move fluidly with natural-looking transitions.
- **Interactive Control**: Change motion styles on the fly using number keys (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`).
- **Massive Swarm Simulation**: Capable of rendering thousands of boids with efficient performance.
- **Screen Wrapping**: Boids seamlessly wrap around screen edges for uninterrupted movement.
